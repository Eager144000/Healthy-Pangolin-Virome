# Healthy Pangolin Virome
##Zoonotic-rank

We assessed the zoonotic potential of 51 vOUTs, among which seven (MJ_Lung27-Parvoviridae-1, UN_MBA191009-Parvoviridae-1, UN_MBA191016-Parvoviridae-1, UN_MBA191038-Parvoviridae-1, UN_MBO191007-Parvoviridae-1, UN_MBO191020-Parvoviridae-1, and UN_MBO191045-Parvoviridae-1) were classified under the family Parvoviridae, within the unclassified genus containing Densovirinae sp. and Pangolin densovirus A1.
Members of the subfamily Densovirinae typically infect invertebrates such as insects, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Given that adult pangolins consume up to 70 million insects annually, we consider it likely that the desovirus-related sequences identified in this study originated from their insect-based diet.
Accordingly, we excluded these sequences from downstream analyses and visualizations.
